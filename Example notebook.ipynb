Made it through 9th grade, but my parents pulled me out in 10th grade and sent me to private school because the commute was just too much. It was expensive as hell and our quality of life definitely went down so that they could foot the bill, but I wound up at a good university (top 25 in the US) so it was worth it and I'm thankful for it. \n",
