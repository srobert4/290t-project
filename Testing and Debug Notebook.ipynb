You'd win a Nobel prize.\\n\\nNot that I disagree with your solution though.  The lottery is kinda useless.  If we assigned based on local school, we'd have what we have in the burbs... the homes in desirable school zones would skyrocket.  And parents with money would afford to live there and send their kids there.\\n\\nAnd what's the #1 correlation for how well kids do in school?  How well educated their parents are.  And of course, that also correlates to how much they earn... and in the US, how much you earn correlates to race.\\n\\nSo we'll just end up with poor parents, who *statistically* have lower performing kids, concentrated in the cheaper parts of the city.\\n\\n**But that's essentially what we have now**.  Parents with money are educated and work hard to get their kids in the schools they think are good.  The lottery for those schools are overwhelmed with those kids, and the final lottery assignment shows it.\\n\\nParents who don't care about school (statistically poor), and parents who might care but are too poor to be able to get their kids two neighborhoods over?  They get assigned nearby anyway- either because it's convenient or because they have no choice.  And now those kids are concentrated in a \\\"bad school\\\".\\n\\nMy ultimate point is that it's either gonna be the lottery or how much home you can afford that determines where you go, but the demographics aren't going to change much.  The lottery is at least *a little* more egalitarian, and gives a few kids in bad areas a chance to get into a school with a more studious population.  And you aren't going to fix a bad school in this city without swapping the kids out of it.  When you concentrate kids from families that aren't educated, you get a lower performing school.
